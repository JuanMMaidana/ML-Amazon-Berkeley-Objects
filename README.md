# Amazon Berkeley Objects Classification

This project explores image classification using the **Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO) Dataset**, a large-scale dataset containing rich visual and contextual information. The aim is to build a model capable of identifying and categorizing objects in images, leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## About the Dataset

The [Amazon Berkeley Objects Dataset](https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) (ABO) is a comprehensive collection of images, metadata, and labels. It is designed for object classification, retrieval, and other computer vision tasks.  

### Key Features:
- **Diverse Categories:** Thousands of objects from various product categories.
- **Metadata-Rich:** Includes details like brand, title, and product descriptions.
- **Large-Scale:** Covers millions of annotated images, making it ideal for training complex models.

The dataset is publicly available and formatted for straightforward integration into machine learning pipelines.

## Project Goals and Approach

The primary goal is to create a robust image classifier that achieves high accuracy across a wide range of product categories. To accomplish this, the project is divided into the following phases:

1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing:**
   - Analyze the dataset structure.
   - Handle missing or inconsistent annotations.
   - Resize and normalize images for model training.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Train baseline models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM).
   - Experiment with deep learning architectures such as CNNs and pre-trained models (e.g., VGG, ResNet).
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

3. **Evaluation and Insights:**
   - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Analyze misclassified examples to understand model limitations.
   - Interpret feature importance for better transparency.

## Tools and Technologies

This project uses a combination of traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks:

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for deep learning
  - OpenCV for image processing
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations
  - Scikit-learn for traditional ML models

A Jupyter Notebook is included for an interactive exploration of the data and models.
